Class that stores information about an attire's details, including type, model (`mdl` URI), texture (`tex` URI), tint, hue, brightness, overlay, and more. Every information about the data is included in the game assets.

It includes helper methods such as `clone`, `clear`, and `parseXML`. It utilizes `AttireOverlay`, that holds type and texture for additional overlays within the attire.
